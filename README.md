# Lesser-known programming languages
The list of lesser-known programming languages that you might be interested in.

## Contents
- [Adept](https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept) - A blazing fast language for general purpose programming.
- [Covariant Script](https://github.com/covscript/covscript) - Covariant Script is an open source, cross-platform programming language. High-performance runtime environment. Self-developed efficient compilation system. Powerful and bloat-free extension system.
- [Elena](https://github.com/ELENA-LANG/elena-lang) - ELENA is a general-purpose language with late binding. It is multi-paradigm, combining features of functional and object-oriented programming. Rich set of tools are provided to deal with message dispatching : multi-methods, message qualifying, generic message handlers, run-time interfaces.
- [Fennel](https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel) - Fennel is a lisp that compiles to Lua. It aims to be easy to use, expressive, and has almost zero overhead compared to writing Lua directly.
- [Janet](https://github.com/janet-lang/janet) - Janet is a functional and imperative programming language and bytecode interpreter. It is a lisp-like language, but lists are replaced by other data structures (arrays, tables (hash table), struct (immutable hash table), tuples). The language also supports bridging to native code written in C, meta-programming with macros, and bytecode assembly.
- [Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka) - Koka: a functional language with effects. Koka is a strongly typed functional-style language with effect types and handlers.
- [L.B.Stanza](https://lbstanza.org/) - L.B. Stanza (or Stanza for short) is a new optionally-typed general purpose programming language from the University of California, Berkeley. Stanza was designed to help programmers tackle the complexity of architecting large programs and significantly increase the productivity of application programmers across the entire software development life cycle.
- [Quirrel](https://github.com/GaijinEntertainment/quirrel) - Quirrel - Gaijin Entertainment dynamic script language (former Squirrel).
- [Racket](https://github.com/racket/racket) - A general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language and a multi-platform distribution that includes the Racket language, compiler, large standard library, IDE, development tools, and a set of additional languages including Typed Racket (a sister language of Racket with a static type-checker), Swindle, FrTime, Lazy Racket, R5RS & R6RS Scheme, Scribble, Datalog, Racklog, Algol 60 and several teaching languages.
- [Slang](https://github.com/slang-lang/slang) - Statically typed scripting language... syntax errors should be catched at design time!
- [Tamgu(탐구)](https://github.com/naver/tamgu) - A FIL Language that combines in one language an imperative paradigm, a functional paradigm and a logical paradigm. Mixes in one code _A Python-like formalism, a Haskell-like formalism and a Prolog-like formalism_.
- [Unison](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison) - Unison is a modern, statically-typed purely functional language, similar to Haskell, but with the ability to describe entire distributed systems with a single program.
- [V1](https://github.com/mwiedeV1/v1) - V1 is a simple functional interpreter language with syntax from C, PHP and JavaScript. It was developed from the scratch. The focus is on administrative and experimental programming, but it has enhanced benefits like Multithreading, CGI, Web functions and native function calling. The most buildin functions are compatible with PHP, for example fopen().
- [Yuescript](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript) - Yuescript is a Moonscript dialect. It is derived from Moonscript language 0.5.0 and continuously adopting new features to be more up to date. Moonscript is a language that compiles to Lua. Since original Moonscript has been used to write web framework lapis and run a few business web sites like itch.io and streak.club with some large code bases. The original language is getting too hard to adopt new features for those may break the stablility for existing applications.
